# Kang-WebSite
ULR is ehdrn3020.dothome.co.kr. You can see desigh and how it works.

Explaination : By programming the website, I promote myself and Use as a E-diary by adding the functions I need. Using the bootstrap, I designed a reactive web site that can be viewed on any device. 

Structure : It consists of four main pages. [Home], [Profile], [Reference], [Work]. Each page is connected to the database by PHP. So it implements functions such as Information Board and my own Bookmark.
